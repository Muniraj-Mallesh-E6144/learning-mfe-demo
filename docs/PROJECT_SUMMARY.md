# Project Summary - Learning MFE Demo

## What Was Built

This is a **complete, production-like microfrontend architecture** demonstrating how Freshservice integrates Ember and React.

### Components Created

1. **Backend (Rails)**
   - REST API with Users and Tickets
   - CORS configuration
   - SQLite database
   - Seed data for testing

2. **Ember Host Application**
   - Main routing and navigation
   - Three integration patterns (full Ember, hybrid, full React)
   - render-react-component bridge
   - API service for backend calls

3. **React UI Component Library**
   - Button, Card, Table components
   - Built with Vite
   - TypeScript types
   - Storybook ready

4. **React Microfrontend**
   - UsersTable, TicketsList, TicketDetail components
   - Module Federation configuration
   - MessageChannel communication
   - Standalone and embedded modes

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Getting started guide
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Individual component READMEs
   - Learning notes in every file

## File Count

```

Documentation:      ~5,000 lines (Markdown)
Total:              ~13,500 lines
```

## Key Files

### Critical for Understanding

1. **ember-host/app/components/render-react-component/component.js**
   - The bridge between Ember and React
   - Handles Module Federation loading
   - Sets up MessageChannel communication

2. **react-mfe/vite.config.ts**
   - Module Federation configuration
   - Shared dependency setup
   - Build configuration

3. **react-mfe/src/bootstrap-rc.tsx**
   - Entry point for embedded React components
   - Component registry
   - Communication setup

4. **backend/config/initializers/cors.rb**
   - CORS configuration
   - Critical for cross-origin requests

5. **ember-host/config/environment.js**
   - Environment configuration
   - API and MFE URLs

## Integration Patterns Demonstrated

### Pattern 1: Full Ember Page
**Example:** Dashboard page
- Ember handles everything
- Traditional Ember development
- Good for simple pages

**Files:**
- `ember-host/app/routes/dashboard.js`
- `ember-host/app/templates/dashboard.hbs`

### Pattern 2: Hybrid Page
**Example:** Users page
- Ember manages route and data
- React renders table component
- Best of both worlds

**Files:**
- `ember-host/app/templates/users.hbs`
- `react-mfe/src/components/UsersTable.tsx`

### Pattern 3: Full React MFE
**Example:** Tickets page
- Ember provides route shell
- React handles everything else
- Complete feature isolation

**Files:**
- `ember-host/app/templates/tickets.hbs`
- `react-mfe/src/components/TicketsList.tsx`

## Technology Decisions

### Why These Technologies?

**Rails Backend:**
- Mirrors Freshservice's backend
- Rapid API development
- ActiveRecord for data modeling

**Ember Host:**
- Freshservice's legacy framework
- Mature routing system
- Excellent for large applications

**React MFE:**
- Modern, component-based
- Large ecosystem
- Team expertise

**Module Federation:**
- Runtime code sharing
- Independent deployment
- Shared dependencies

**Vite:**
- Fast build times
- Modern build tool
- Great DX

## Learning Journey

- [ ] Read all READMEs

**Expected Time:** 8-10 hours

### Intermediate Path (Week 2)
- [ ] Study Module Federation
- [ ] Understand communication patterns
- [ ] Make small changes
- [ ] Debug issues

**Expected Time:** 12-15 hours

### Advanced Path (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Build new features
- [ ] Add authentication
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Deploy to production

**Expected Time:** 20-30 hours

## Interview Preparation

### Key Topics to Master

1. **Microfrontend Architecture**
   - Benefits and trade-offs
   - When to use MFEs
   - Alternative approaches

2. **Module Federation**
   - How it works
   - Shared dependencies
   - Version management

3. **Framework Integration**
   - Ember ‚Üî React communication
   - Props serialization
   - Event handling

4. **API Design**
   - RESTful principles
   - CORS configuration
   - Error handling

5. **Build Tools**
   - Vite vs Webpack
   - Module resolution
   - Production optimization

### Practice Questions

1. "Walk me through how a React component loads in the Ember app"
2. "How do Ember and React share the same React instance?"
3. "What happens if the React MFE fails to load?"
4. "How would you add authentication to this architecture?"
5. "What are the trade-offs of microfrontends vs monoliths?"
