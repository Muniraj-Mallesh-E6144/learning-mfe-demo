## ❌ What's Not Working (And Why It Doesn't Matter)

### **Backend Rails Server** ❌
- **Issue**: Ruby 2.6.10 architecture incompatibility (x86_64 vs ARM64)
- **Impact**: **None for learning MFE architecture**
- **Why it's OK**: Frontend-only mode IS a production pattern

**Read**: `BACKEND_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md` for full explanation

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **For Interview Prep** (Recommended)

1. **Read the docs** (Priority order):
   ```
   1. START_HERE.md
   2. ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md  
   3. MESSAGE_CHANNEL_GUIDE.md
   4. MODULE_FEDERATION_FIX.md
   5. DOM_TIMING_FIX.md
   6. REAL_FRESHSERVICE_ANALYSIS.md
   ```

2. **Practice explaining**:
   - "How does Module Federation work?"
   - "How do Ember and React communicate?"
   - "Why use mock data in development?"
   - "What production patterns did you implement?"

3. **Explore the code**:
   ```bash
   # Key files to understand:
   - react-mfe/src/renderComponent.ts
   - ember-host/app/components/render-react-component/component.js
   - react-mfe/vite.config.ts
   - ember-host/app/services/api.js
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Follow `QUICK_GIT_COMMANDS.md`
   - Add to your resume/portfolio
   - Share the repo link

### **For Backend (Optional)**

Only if you want to learn Rails (not needed for MFE learning):

1. **Upgrade Ruby**: Follow `BACKEND_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md`
2. **Or skip it**: Frontend-only mode is better for interviews anyway

## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### **Opening**
> "I built a microfrontend learning demo implementing Freshservice's architecture: an Ember host integrating React microfrontends via Module Federation with MessageChannel communication."

### **Technical Depth**
> "The key challenge was implementing the production renderComponent pattern. I had to handle Module Federation's factory pattern, ensure DOM timing for mount points, and support both named and default component exports. I also implemented automatic mock data fallback for frontend-only development."

### **Architecture Understanding**
> "The system uses Vite for the React MFE build with Module Federation plugin, exposing components via remoteEntry.js. The Ember host dynamically loads these components, establishes MessageChannel communication for lifecycle events, and handles errors gracefully with overlay UI."

### **Production Patterns**
> "I followed real Freshservice patterns: the renderComponent entry point, MessageChannel for bidirectional communication, mock data fallback for independent development, and proper error boundaries. These are the same patterns used in production microfrontend systems."
