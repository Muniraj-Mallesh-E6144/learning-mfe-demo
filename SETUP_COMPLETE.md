# ✅ Setup Progress

## Status: Almost Ready! 

### What's Working ✅

1. **Project Structure** - All files created
2. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides ready
3. **Frontend Setup** - React MFE and Ember configured
4. **Ember Configuration** - Octane features configured

### What Needs Attention ⚠️

**Ruby Version Issue** - Your Ruby 2.6.10 is too old

## 🚀 Next Steps (Choose One)

### Option A: Upgrade Ruby (Recommended - 15 min)

**Best for full learning experience**

```bash
# Install rbenv
brew install rbenv ruby-build
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Install Ruby 3.1
rbenv install 3.1.0

# Set for backend
cd /Users/mmallesh/Documents/Repos/learning-mfe-demo/backend
rbenv local 3.1.0

# Verify
ruby -v  # Should show 3.1.0

# Install gems and setup
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed

# Start backend (Terminal 1)
rails server -p 3000
```

Then start the frontends:
```bash
# Terminal 2 - Ember
cd /Users/mmallesh/Documents/Repos/learning-mfe-demo/ember-host
pnpm start

# Terminal 3 - React MFE
cd /Users/mmallesh/Documents/Repos/learning-mfe-demo/react-mfe
pnpm dev

# Visit http://localhost:4200
```

---

### Option B: Frontend Only (No Ruby Needed - 5 min)

**Good for learning React-Ember integration**

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Ember
cd /Users/mmallesh/Documents/Repos/learning-mfe-demo/ember-host
pnpm start

# Terminal 2 - React MFE (Standalone)
cd /Users/mmallesh/Documents/Repos/learning-mfe-demo/react-mfe
pnpm dev

# Visit:
# - http://localhost:4200 (Ember - will show without data)
# - http://localhost:5000 (React standalone - works fully)
```

**What You'll Learn:**
- ✅ Module Federation configuration
- ✅ React-Ember integration
- ✅ Component architecture
- ✅ Build tool setup
- ⚠️ API integration (needs backend)

---

### Option C: Use Docker (Coming Soon)

Docker setup will handle Ruby for you automatically.
